### Service to effective & entertaining education of learning treatment from urgent disaster.

Crisis can occur anytime, anywhere.

To this end, the educational field is obligated to educate students to cope with disasters and emergencies.

However, most education is limited to theory and does not attract students' interest, resulting in inefficient information delivery.

I would like to propose a new educational service so that students can be interested.

# 🎙️ Introduction
## System needs to be improved

According to the status of first aid education conducted by the Korea Consumer Agency in 2021.

Of the 500 surveyed, 346 (69.2%) answered that the current first aid education needs to be improved.

As shown in the table upper, the necessity of improving first aid education is an opinion that a significant number of the public agrees.

## Reason for lack of education

In addition, there is an opinion that sufficient education is not provided due to the lack of training opportunities and training equipment for education that is already being implemented.

Considering the monetary and administrative aspects, it can be assumed that it is an area that is difficult to improve quickly.

## Right treatment saves lives

By doing CPR, we can double up the chance of reviving heart attacked person.

This also applies to other treatments.

## The problem, not only for the Korea but for the world

the problem is not just a problem in Korea, but it is even more serious worldwide, especially in countries with insufficient educational infrastructure.

We know empirically and numerically that we are more vulnerable to emergencies such as disasters in areas that lack all-around infrastructure. We believe that our services will do its best part in these areas.
